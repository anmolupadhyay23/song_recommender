# song_recommender
A simple song recommender system based on a dataset taken from kaggle with 500 data points 
This is not a complete use of dataset
We have just used 'artist', 'writers',  'producer' and based on these three features of a song the machine learning model recommends similar songs
We have used cosine similarity and the concept of Text Vectorization
We have furthur used stemming and reduced the duplicate data to increase the efficiency of model
